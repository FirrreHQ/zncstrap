zncstrap
========

A simple ZNC Web-Interface theme build with Twitter Bootstrap Framework.

####Installing zncstrap

Step 1 - Get a latest version of zncstrap. Install Git / Git Core on your Linux machine or alternativly, install and use wget or aget tool; or the good ole way via FTP/sFTP.
Step 2 - We strongly advice you to make backups of your current files/folders before you proceed to install zncstrap. Once you have your backups stored elsewhere, you can proceed to delete/remove the default theme(s). 
Step 3 - Navigate to ~/znc/share/znc/webskins and delete all those files as we will no longer be needing them.
Step 4 - Once it has completely removed, you can now go ahead and upload all files in the '~/zncstrap-v0.1/webskins' folder.
~/zncstrap-v.0.1/webskins  <->  ~/znc/share/znc/webskins
Step 5 - Now, you will need to overwrite the modules
~/zncstrap-v.0.1/modules  <->  ~/znc/share/znc/modules
Once completed, you're good to go! - Login to your web-interface http://ip:port or http://domain.ltd:port via any of your preferred web browsers.

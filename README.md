========

A simple ZNC Web-Interface theme build with Twitter Bootstrap Framework.

This 'dev' (development) branch is mainly for ZNC v.1.5-git or later.

### To-Do

- The user setings page is way too long. Find a way to make it short yet organized
- Clean out the codes and align accordingly
- Swap to a switch-like checkbox
- Test Google Charts to output Traffic data, visually 
- Tables should be made more responsive, able to view on smaller devices
